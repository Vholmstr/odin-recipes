This is a simple website i made for training html and css as a part 
of The Odin Project web developer course.

In this project i have used basic html and css to setup and style my website. I've used different html elements for different parts of the website, classes to style the elements and also multiple css properties including flexbox to change how the content is displayed on the website.
